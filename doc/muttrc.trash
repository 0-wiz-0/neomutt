# Example Mutt config file for the 'trash' feature.

# This feature defines a new 'trash' folder.
# When mail is deleted it will be moved to this folder.

# Folder in which to put deleted emails
set trash='+Trash'
set trash='/home/flatcap/Mail/Trash'

# The default delete key 'd' will move an email to the 'trash' folder
# Bind 'D' to REALLY delete an email
bind index D purge-message

# Note: Deleting emails from the 'trash' folder will REALLY delete them.
